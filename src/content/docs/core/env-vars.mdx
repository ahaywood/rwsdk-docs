title: Environment Variables & Secrets
description: RedwoodSDK Environment Variables

When integrating with external services you typically store your credentials in environment variables. This is done to avoid hardcoding secrets into your codebase.

There are several environments that require different credentials, for example:

- On your local machine: Development
- Secrets on deployed Workers: Staging & Production

We follow Cloudflare's [recommended approach](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/) for workers.

## Development

Create a `.dev.vars` file in the root of your project.

```ts title=".dev.vars"
SECRET_KEY = "value";
API_TOKEN = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
```

This file will be used when you run the development server.

## Secrets on deployed Workers

```bash
npx wrangler secret put <KEY>
```

These can also be added via the Cloudflare dashboard.
