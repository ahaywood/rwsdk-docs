import { Aside, FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Now, that we have a way of displaying our applications, we need a way of adding new ones.

First, let's take a look at our design, in Figma, and what we're building.

![](./images/figma-new-application-form.png)

In the last section, we set up the `/applications/new` route, but we haven't created the page.

Inside the `src/app/pages/applications` folder, let's create a new file called `New.tsx`.

<FileTree>
- src/
  - app/
    - pages/
      - applications/
        - New.tsx
</FileTree>

We can stub out a basic component:

```tsx title="src/app/pages/applications/New.tsx"
import { InteriorLayout } from "@/app/layouts/InteriorLayout"

const New = () => {
  return (
    <InteriorLayout>
      <div>New</div>
    </InteriorLayout>
  )
}

export { New }
---
I went ahead and wrapped our component with the `InteriorLayout` component.
---
```

In order to see the changes that we're making in the browser, we need to update our worker.

```diff title="src/worker.tsx" collapse={4-7}
import { New } from "./app/pages/applications/New";
...
render(Document, [
  index([ isAuthenticated, Home ]),
  prefix("/user", userRoutes),
  route("/legal/privacy", () => <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>),
  route("/legal/terms", () => <h1>Terms of Service</h1>),
  prefix("/applications", [
    route("/", [isAuthenticated, List]),
-    route("/new", [isAuthenticated, () => <h1>New Application</h1>]),
+    route("/new", [isAuthenticated, New]),
    route("/:id", [isAuthenticated, () => <h1>Application</h1>]),
  ]),
]),
```

Originally, we defined our `/new` route, returning an `h1` element that said "New Application". Let's change that to return our `New` component instead.

Then, be sure to import the `New` component at the top of the file:

```tsx title="src/worker.tsx" collapse={4-7}
import { New } from "./app/pages/applications/New";
```

Inside our `New` component, let's start building our page.

At the top, we have breadcrumbs, helping the user know where they are and navigate back.

Conveniently, ShadCN has a `Breadcrumb` component that we can use.

Just like the Applications Table, let's start by copying and pasting the code directly from [ShadCN's documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/breadcrumb) into our component:

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
import { Breadcrumb, BreadcrumbList, BreadcrumbItem, BreadcrumbLink, BreadcrumbPage, BreadcrumbSeparator } from "@/app/components/ui/breadcrumb"
...
<Breadcrumb>
  <BreadcrumbList>
    <BreadcrumbItem>
      <BreadcrumbLink href="/">Home</BreadcrumbLink>
    </BreadcrumbItem>
    <BreadcrumbSeparator />
    <BreadcrumbItem>
      <BreadcrumbLink href="/components">Components</BreadcrumbLink>
    </BreadcrumbItem>
    <BreadcrumbSeparator />
    <BreadcrumbItem>
      <BreadcrumbPage>Breadcrumb</BreadcrumbPage>
    </BreadcrumbItem>
  </BreadcrumbList>
</Breadcrumb>
```

Now, we an start modifying the code to fit our needs.

```diff title="src/app/pages/applications/New.tsx"
<InteriorLayout>
    <Breadcrumb>
      <BreadcrumbList>
        <BreadcrumbItem>
-         <BreadcrumbLink href="/">Home</BreadcrumbLink>
+         <BreadcrumbLink href="/applications">Applications</BreadcrumbLink>
        </BreadcrumbItem>
-         <BreadcrumbSeparator />
-         <BreadcrumbItem>
-           <BreadcrumbLink href="/components">Components</BreadcrumbLink>
-         </BreadcrumbItem>
        <BreadcrumbSeparator />
        <BreadcrumbItem>
-          <BreadcrumbPage>Breadcrumb</BreadcrumbPage>
+          <BreadcrumbPage>Add an Application</BreadcrumbPage>
        </BreadcrumbItem>
      </BreadcrumbList>
    </Breadcrumb>
</InteriorLayout>
```

- I've adjusted the first `BreadcrumbLink` to point to the Applications list page.
- We can get rid of the second `BreadcrumbItem`.
- For the third `BreadcrumbItem`, I've changed the label from `Breadcrumb` to `Add an Application`.

At the top of the `src/app/components/ui/breadcrumb.tsx` file, we need to add a `use client` directive, otherwise our page will error out.

```tsx title="src/app/components/ui/breadcrumb.tsx"
"use client"
```

Let's wrap our breadcrumbs with a `div` and add a few classes to adjust the spacing.

```tsx title="src/app/pages/applications/New.tsx" collapse={4-14} {3,15} startLineNumber=5 "mb-12 -mt-7 pl-[120px]"
return (
  <InteriorLayout>
    <div className="mb-12 -mt-7 pl-[120px]">
      <Breadcrumb>
        <BreadcrumbList>
          <BreadcrumbItem>
            <BreadcrumbLink href="/applications">Applications</BreadcrumbLink>
          </BreadcrumbItem>
          <BreadcrumbSeparator />
          <BreadcrumbItem>
            <BreadcrumbPage>Add an Application</BreadcrumbPage>
          </BreadcrumbItem>
        </BreadcrumbList>
      </Breadcrumb>
    </div>
  </InteriorLayout>
);
```

- I added `48px` of margin on the bottom with `mb-12`
- I put a negative margin of `28px` on the top to move the breadcrumbs up.
- I added `120px` of padding on the left.

Next up, let's add our page heading:

```tsx title="src/app/pages/applications/New.tsx" startLineNumber=20
<div className="mx-page-side pb-6 mb-8 border-b-1 border-border">
  <h1 className="page-title">New Application</h1>
  <p className="page-description">Create a new application</p>
</div>
```

- On the wrapping `div`, we have a few classes that adjusts the spacing and adds a border to the bottom.
  - `mx-page-side` uses our custom utility class to add `40px` of padding on the left and right.
  - `pb-6` adds `24px` of padding on the bottom.
  - `mb-8` adds `32px` of margin on the bottom.
  - `border-b-1 border-border` adds a border to the bottom of the `div`.
- Here, we've added an `h1` that says "New Application" and has a class called `page-title`
- Then, we have a `p` of text that says "Create a new application." I went ahead and added a class of `page-description` so that we can use this on multiple pages, but we'll need to add this class definition to our `styles.css` file.

```css title="src/app/styles.css" startLineNumber={268}
.page-description {
  @apply text-zinc-500;
}
---
This sets the default color of our `page-description` to a light gray, using class provided by Tailwind.
---
```

Moving down the page, we have a two column form. There are parts of our form that will need state and interactivity, meaning our component will need to be a client component. Instead of making the entire page a client component, let's create a separate component, just for our form.

Inside the `src/app/components` folder, let's create a new file called `ApplicationForm.tsx`.

<FileTree>
- src/
  - app/
    - components/
      - ApplicationForm.tsx
</FileTree>

Stubbing out our component:

```tsx title="src/app/components/ApplicationForm.tsx"
"use client"

const ApplicationsForm = () => {
  return (
    <div>ApplicationsForm</div>
  )
}

export {ApplicationsForm}
---
You'll notice I also placed the `use client` directive at the top of the file, converting this file to a client component.
---
```

Before we start building out our Application Form, let's add it to the `New.tsx` file.

```tsx title="src/app/pages/applications/New.tsx" showLineNumbers={false} {6}
import { ApplicationsForm } from "@/app/components/ApplicationsForm"
...
<div className="mx-page-side pb-6 mb-8 border-b-1 border-border">
    <h1 className="page-title">New Application</h1>
    <p className="page-description">Create a new application</p>
  </div>
  <ApplicationsForm />
```

Now, let's wrap our `<div>ApplicationsForm</div>` with a `form` tag and add some styles:

```tsx title="src/app/pages/applications/New.tsx" startLineNumber=5
<form>
  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-[200px] px-page-side mb-[75px]">
    ApplicationForm
  <div>
</form>
```

- On our `div`, I added a class of `grid` and gave it two columns, `grid-cols-2`. I also put a `200px` gap between the two columns.
- On the left and right side, I added `40px` of padding with our custom utility class, `px-page-side`.
- Finally, I added `75px` of margin on the bottom with `mb-[75px]`.

Now, let's start building out our form.

```tsx title="src/app/components/ApplicationForm.tsx"
<form>
  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-[200px] px-page-side mb-[75px]">
    ApplicationForm
  <div>
</form>
```
